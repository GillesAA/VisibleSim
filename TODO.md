# TODO â€“ Future improvements and issues

## Issues to address

### User Interactions 
- [ ] Catoms2D Rotations from the menu are sometimes mistakenly authorized, and blocks sometimes perform 2 rotations at a time.

## Improvements

### Meld Interpreter
- [ ] Enable Meld action for generic motion events (Translation, Rotation 2D/3D)

### Configuration Files
- [ ] Camera and Spotlight elements could be automatically deduced from the rest of the data in the configuration file.
