==================

Refactoring goals:


1. world(s): refactoring, universal xml reading, universal random generator.

2. block functionalities: linear motor, rotation motor, clock, color.
user should use universal blockcode to be able to run the code on any target (blinky blocks, smart blocks, …), if the device has the functionality (like linear motor, …).

3. system messages vs application message to implement libraries like spanning-tree, clock synchronization, tuple space, overlay…
